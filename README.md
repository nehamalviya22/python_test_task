Code explanation:
1. Create models(tables) - There are 2 tables:
   one is username with username,advertisement count and impression count field.
   and the other is the sdkversion with sdk version, advertise count and impression count field.

2. Create views - There are 3 classes:
one is Getadvertisement in which you send some parameters and if the same user requests for   an ad, increase the ad count per user and save it into a database.
Same for the sdk version if the user sends the same version, increase the ad count per sdk version and save into the database.
Also it returns the xml file containing the advertisement clip.
Another is GetImpression in which you send some parameters and if the same user requests for   an impression, increase the impression count per user and save it into a database.
Same for the sdk version if the user sends the same version, increase the impression count per sdk version and save into the database.
Last one is GetStats in which you send some filter parameters and it will calculate the fill rate by using ad count and impression count of user and sdk version both. Then return json content with fill rate.
